====================================
OP (The optimization plugin package)
====================================

OP is a general optimization solver interface. It's primary purpose is to faciliate experimenting with different optimization solvers. It allows users to writing new objective functions in a general and abstract framework, and helps convert objective functions hard-coded for other optimization interfaces and using them with a general set of optimizers. It also contains an MPI-abstraction interface library as well as additional MPI-patterns to make it significantly easier to perform halo-exchanges necessary in parallelizing optimization problems.
