The two-constraint Rosenbrock Example
=====================================

``op`` provides several implementations of the two-constraint `rosenbrock problem  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization#Test_functions_for_constrained_optimization>`_ to illustrate the changes needed to `port between different optimizers <sphinx/porting.html>`_ as well as highlighting ways ``op`` helps reduce the complexity in migrating from serial optimization problems to parallel optimization problems.
